# Introduction

Since September 2017, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Center for Mathematical Modeling](http://www.cmm.uchile.cl/), Universidad de Chile, Santiago. My  research interests are centered on the stochastic algorithms used in Machine Learning. I like going back and forth between theoretical analysis, usually by means of Markov asymptotic theory, and applications, currently in seismic tomography.
