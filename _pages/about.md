# Introduction

Since January 2020, I am a Research Associate at the Department of Mathematical Sciences of the University of Bath, where I work with [Matthias Ehrhardt](https://mehrhardt.github.io/index.html) on the project [PET++](https://petpp.github.io). My  research interests are centered on the stochastic algorithms used in Machine Learning and Optimization, applied to medical and seismic tomography.
