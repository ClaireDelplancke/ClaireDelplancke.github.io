# Internship supervision
* 2019, Bernardita Ried, 4rd year Physics and Astronomy student at Universidad de Chile, on *The Zig-Zag process for Bayesian sampling*.

As an output of the internship, Bernardita wrote a [Jupyter tutorial](https://github.com/bernarditaried/ZigZag-Sampling-Tutorial "GitHub link") serving as an accessible introduction to the algorithm described in the article *The Zig-Zag process and super efficient sampling for Bayesian analysis of big data*, by Bierkens, Fearnhead and Roberts.
* 2019, Andrés Riveros, 5th year Mathematical Engineering student at Universidad de Chile, on *Efficiency and Convergence of time-continuous Monte Carlo Markov Chains methods*.
* 2018, Léa Rault, 3rd year Mathematical Engineering student at INSA Rennes, France, on *Fast marching algorithm for Eikonal equation and its derivatives*.
* 2018, Bastien Nony, 4th year Mathematical Engineering student at INSA Toulouse, France, on *Variational Expectation-Maximization algorithm for velocity reconstruction in seismic tomography*.
